# Essential JS VS Code Extensions

## Directions

1. Adjust the `my-vscode-extensions.txt` file to fit whatever extensions you want
(ensure that each extension gets its own line in the text file).

2. Make `vscode-extensions-installer` file executable:
```bash
chmod +x vscode-extensions-installer
```

3. Run the script with:
```bash
./vscode-extensions-installer
```
